Optional description 
## Ingredients:
* 1 lb salted butter
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 2 cups sugar
* 2 cups chocolate chips

#### Optional Ingredients:
* 1 cup chopped nuts (almonds or pecans work great!)
* 1/2 cup white chocolate chips
 
## Instructions:
1. In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan add butter, sugar, and salt.  Cook over medium heat, stirring until the butter is melted.  It will start to boil.  Cook, stirring occasionally until it becomes the same shade as a brown paper bag (I've put a bag on the counter next to the stove to match the color) or until it reaches 285 degrees if you have a candy thermometer. Undercooking the butter and sugar will result in grainy, crumbly, toffee-like crumbs that aren't right.
2. While the toffee is cooking, cover a large cookie sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
When toffee is ready, pour it into the cookie sheet and sprinkle the chocolate chips on top and let them sit for a minute to get warm and soften.  With a knife or spatula, spread the chocolate into a thin layer.
3. If using white chocolate chips, place random clumps of them on top of the chocolate. Using a clean spoon or spatula, spread the white chocolate until it forms marble-like streaks in the chocolate. 
4. If using nuts, sprinkle the nuts over the chocolate and press them in a little. 
5. Scoring the toffee at this point will make it easier to break into pieces once set, but itâ€™s not necessary.
6. Place the toffee in the refrigerator and chill until set. If you leave it on the counter, it will still harden, but it will take longer.
7. Break into pieces and enjoy!


### Variations:
* Place some pretzels on the cookie sheet and pour the toffee on top of the pretzels.
* Place the nuts on the cookie sheet and pour the toffee on top of the nuts (as opposed to sprinkling the nuts on top like in above step 4.)

### Pairs well with:
* dessert trays
* office bribes
