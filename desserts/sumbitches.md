Inspired by How I Met Your Mother season 10.

## Ingredients:
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup peanut flour or PB2
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup butter
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 1 cup loosely packed brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup smooth peanut butter
* 1 cup chunky peanut butter
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* Mixins:
  * 1/4 cup chocolate chips
  * 1/4 cup Skor bits
  * 1/4 cup pecans

#### Optional Mixins:
* 2 tbsp salted caramel chips
* Replace Skor bits with quartered vanilla caramels. This is probably the correct way. I just have no patience for unwrapping those things.

 
## Instructions:
1. Numbered list starting with pre heating or other prep instructions. Preheat the oven to 350. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, peanut flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
3. In a different bowl, cream the butter and both sugars together until smooth. 
4. Add the eggs and mix until combined. 
5. Add the peanut butter and vanilla, mix until combined.
6. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.
7. Add the chocolate chips and/or peanuts if using.
8. Cover and chill dough in refridgerator for minumum 1 hour, maximum 2 days.
9. Roll dough into 1 tbsp balls. Use a fork to squish the balls down on the pan.
10. Bake each batch of cookies for 10-12 minutes until just barely browned on the sides. Seriously, the cookies should still seem raw to you. Don't worry about that... they'll continue cooking in the next step.
11. Remove from oven. Cool cookies on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
12. Repeat steps 9-11 until all the dough is baked, refridgerating dough while waiting for cookies to come out of oven.
13. Apparently these cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. I wouldn't know. They're always eaten long before the 1 week marker.
