## Ingredients:
* 6 jalapeno peppers
* 1/2 brick cream cheese
* 1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt
* 1/3 cup shredded old cheddar cheese
* 6 slices bacon
* Seasonings of choice - I use the following to taste:
  * garlic powder
  * black pepper
  * red pepper flakes
 
## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. If using foil, spray with cooking spray.
2. Cook bacon until flimsy and weird, but not fully cooked. I usually do this first so it's cooled off enough to handle by the time I'm ready to wrap the jalapenos.
3. Either cut jalapenos in half and remove seeds or use an apple corer to remove the stem and seeds. I find better results going in from the top.
4. In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, Greek yogurt, cheddar cheese and seasonings. You may need to nuke the cream cheese for 15-30 seconds to soften it.
5. Scoop the cream cheese mixture into a ziplock bag (or a pastry bag if you're a fancy bitch). Cut the bottom corner off of the bag.
6. Squeeze the filling out of the corner hole into each of the jalapenos. You'll likely have a bit of filling left. You can either fill more jalapenos, spread it on cracker, or just eat with a spoon. 
7. Using a toothpick, pierce the skin of the jalapeno in a few places. This prevents the jalapeno from getting too squirty when it comes out of the oven.
8. Wrap each of the jalapenos with a piece of bacon, securing with toothpicks.
9. Bake for 15-20 minutes until bacon is cooked to optimal crispness.


## Variations:
* Use mini sweet peppers instead of jalapenos
