3. Heat the milk to room temperature in the microwave; add to bowl and whisk to combine
4. Add 3 cups of flour one at a time; whisking to combine with the mixer until batter leaves ribbon in the bowl (the batter is beginning to gain substance and a spoonful of it can be seen when poured back onto the surface of it for a moment or two)
5. Stir the yeast mixture to combine; add it to the flour mixture and whisk to combine well
6. Remove bowl from mixing stand; continue to fold in remaining 2-2 1/2 cups of flour by hand with a large spoon until a sticky dough ball has formed
7. Lightly flour a work surface; place dough onto the work surface and knead until no longer sticky
8. After kneading for 7-8 minutes; rest for 3-5 minutes
9. Knead again until you hear popping sounds as the rise in the dough crackles with the knead
10. Dough will be soft like a baby's bottom and elastic
11. Butter the bowl; place the dough in the bowl face down, work it a bit and turn it over to proof
12. Cover with a warm damp cloth and place in a warm place until double in size

#### Making the Buns:
1. Preheat the oven to 375 F
2. Lightly flour the work surface; turn the risen dough upside down onto the work surface
3. Fold over onto itself three times; pat it into a rectangle about 12 x 15; dust a large biscuit cutter with flour and cut the buns out of the dough
4. Place the buns on a parchment covered cookie sheet; let raise until double again (a good 30 minutes)
5. Bake for 15 minutes until golden brown; remove from oven and gloss tops of each with butter
6. Cool
