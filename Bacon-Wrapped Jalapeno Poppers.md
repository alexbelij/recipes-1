# Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeno Poppers

Ingredients:
* 6 jalapeno peppers
* 1/2 brick cream cheese
* 1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt
* 1/3 cup shredded old cheddar cheese
* 6 slices bacon
* Seasonings of choice - I use the following to taste:
** garlic powder
** black pepper
** red pepper flakes

Instructions:
# Preheat the oven to 375. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. If using foil, spray with cooking spray.
# Cook bacon until flimsy and weird, but not fully cooked. I usually do this first so it's cooled off enough to handle by the time I'm ready to wrap the jalapenos.
# Either cut jalapenos in half and remove seeds or use an apple corer to remove the stem and seeds. I find better results going in from the top.
# In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, Greek yogurt, cheddar cheese and seasonings. You may need to nuke the cream cheese for 15-30 seconds to soften it.
# Scoop the cream cheese mixture into a ziplock bag (or a pastry bag if you're a fancy bitch). Cut the bottom corner off of the bag.
# Squeeze the filling out of the corner hole into each of the jalapenos. You'll likely have a bit of filling left. You can either fill more jalapenos, spread it on cracker, or just eat with a spoon. 
# Using a toothpick, pierce the skin of the jalapeno in a few places. This prevents the jalapeno from getting too squirty when it comes out of the oven.
# Wrap each of the jalapenos with a piece of bacon, securing with toothpicks.
# Bake for 15-20 minutes until bacon is cooked to optimal crispness.


Variations:
* Use mini sweet peppers instead of jalapenos
