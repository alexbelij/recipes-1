It's almost like pecan pie, except no one looks at you funny for eating it for breakfast.

The prep time includes the 30-40 minutes the dough sits in the fridge before rolling.

## Ingredients:
* 1 cup pitted dates
* 1 cup chopped pecans
* spinkle sea salt

#### Optional Ingredients:
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp butter flavouring
 
## Instructions:
1. Place all ingredients in a food processor.
2. Mix until it forms a dough. If you have trouble turning it into dough, add 1-2 tbsp of water. Dough should be crumbly.
3. Place dough onto parchment paper and roll into a long snake. Wrap the dough and place in the fridge for 30-40 minutes.
3. Remove from fridge and roll into balls.
4. Store in the fridge.


### Variations:
* Roll balls in graham cracker crumbs to get a more pie-like vibe.

### Pairs well with:
* coffee
* vegans
